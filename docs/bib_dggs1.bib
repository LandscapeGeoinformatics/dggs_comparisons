However, previously there has not existed an easy way to map between named places (toponyms) and the cells of a discrete global grid system. The lack of such a tool has limited the opportunities to synthesize social place-based data with the more standard Earth and environmental science data currently being analyzed in Digital Earth applications. This paper introduces Wāhi, the first gazetteer to map entities from the GeoNames database to multiple discrete global grid systems. A gazetteer service is presented that exposes the grid system and the associated gazetteer data as Linked Data. A set of use cases for the discrete global grid gazetteer is discussed.},

abstract = {Upcoming remote sensing systems onboard satellites will generate unprecedented volumes of spatial data, hence challenging processing facilities in terms of storage and processing capacities. Thus, an efficient handling of remote sensing data is of vital importance, demanding a well-suited definition of spatial grids for the data[U+05F3]s storage and manipulation. For high-resolution image data, regular grids defined by map projections have been identified as practicable, cognisant of their drawbacks due to geometric distortions. To this end, we defined a new metric named grid oversampling factor (GOF) that estimates local data oversampling appearing during projection of generic satellite images to a regular raster grid. Based on common map projections, we defined sets of spatial grids optimised to minimise data oversampling. Moreover, they ensure that data undersampling cannot occur at any location. From the resulting GOF-values we concluded that equidistant projections are most suitable, with a global mean oversampling of 2% when using a system of seven continental grids (introduced under the name Equi7 Grid). Opposed to previous studies that suggested equal-area projections, we recommend the Plate Carr{\'{e}}e, the Equidistant Conic and the Equidistant Azimuthal projection for global, hemispherical and continental grids, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Coverages represent a unifying concept for space/time-varying data, especially for spatio-temporal gridded data, nowadays often called “datacubes".

abstract = {The continuous growth of available geospatial data requires new methods for its integration, analysis, and visualization to be explored and implemented in software available to the geospatial community. Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) are an emerging method for spatial data handling in the digital earth framework. DGGS are hierarchical data structures for discretizing the Earth's surface that have seen considerable theoretical development over the last two decades. In this paper, four software implementations are reviewed, dggridR, H3, OpenEAGGR, and S2, to explore their potential applications in data modelling and GIS, as well as their performance. These software implementations were also evaluated against the recently published Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) abstract specification. The results indicate great potential and versatility for utilizing such systems in geospatial analysis, if basic methods for converting and handling spatial features are further developed. The performance of these systems is shown to be highly scalable and operational with datasets of various sizes. Yet, it is demonstrated that the current software implementations generally fall short of fulfilling all of the OGC requirements or it was not possible to confirm their compliance. The assessment here identified that further enhancements, endorsement of OGC criteria, and their explicit acknowledgment within official documentation remain key research needs for the evaluated software packages. Further work developing operational DGGS that solve real world problems may promote greater community adoption and integration of DGGS data structures into commonly used geospatial platforms.},

One possible solution to these challenges is a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS), which was recently announced as a new standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). If Canada plans to utilize a DGGS in the future to reference geospatial data, research is needed to explore characteristics and suitability of different DGGSs. Although hexagonal-and triangular-based DGGSs are popular, the square-based rHEALPix DGGS mirrors the geographic grid more closely and has many advantages.

Offsetting is a fundamental spatial operation that allows us to determine the region within a given distance of an IoT device location, which is important for visualizing or querying nearby location-based data. Thus, in this paper, we present methods of modelling an offset region around the point location of an IoT device (both static and mobile) that is quantized into a cell of a DGGS. Notably, these methods illustrate how the underlying indexing structure of a DGGS can be utilized to determine the cells in an offset region at different spatial resolutions. For a static IoT device location, we describe a single resolution approach as well as a multiresolution approach that allows us to efficiently determine the cells in an offset region at finer (or coarser) resolutions. For mobile IoT device locations, we describe methods to efficiently determine the cells in successive offset regions at fine and coarse resolutions. Lastly, we present a variety of results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {Without geospatial data management, today's challenges in big data applications such as earth observation, geographic information system/building information modeling (GIS/BIM) integration, and 3D/4D city planning cannot be solved. Furthermore, geospatial data management plays a connecting role between data acquisition, data modelling, data visualization, and data analysis. It enables the continuous availability of geospatial data and the replicability of geospatial data analysis. In the first part of this article, five milestones of geospatial data management research are presented that were achieved during the last decade. The first one reflects advancements in BIM/GIS integration at data, process, and application levels. The second milestone presents theoretical progress by introducing topology as a key concept of geospatial data management. In the third milestone, 3D/4D geospatial data management is described as a key concept for city modelling, including subsurface models. Progress in modelling and visualization of massive geospatial features on web platforms is the fourth milestone which includes discrete global grid systems as an alternative geospatial reference framework. The intensive use of geosensor data sources is the fifth milestone which opens the way to parallel data storage platforms supporting data analysis on geosensors. In the second part of this article, five future directions of geospatial data management research are presented that have the potential to become key research fields of geospatial data management in the next decade. Geo-data science will have the task to extract knowledge from unstructured and structured geospatial data and to bridge the gap between modern information technology concepts and the geo-related sciences. Topology is presented as a powerful and general concept to analyze GIS and BIM data structures and spatial relations that will be of great importance in emerging applications such as smart cities and digital twins. Data-streaming libraries and “in-situ” geo-computing on objects executed directly on the sensors will revolutionize geo-information science and bridge geo-computing with geospatial data management. Advanced geospatial data visualization on web platforms will enable the representation of dynamically changing geospatial features or moving objects' trajectories. Finally, geospatial data management will support big geospatial data analysis, and graph databases are expected to experience a revival on top of parallel and distributed data stores supporting big geospatial data analysis.},

A set of 21,872 discrete distortion vindicatrices were positioned on the ellipsoid surface, centred on the cells of a Snyder icosahedral equal-area grid. These indicatrices were projected on the plane and the resulting angular and distance distortions computed, all using FOSS4G. The Homolosine is the only projection that manages to minimise angular and distance distortions simultaneously. It yields the lowest distortions among this set of projections and clearly outclasses when only land masses are considered. These results also indicate the Sinusoidal and Hammer projections to be largely outdated, imposing too large distortions to be useful. In contrast, the Mollweide and Eckert IV projections present trade-offs between visual expression and accuracy that are worth considering. However, for the purposes of storing and analysing big spatial data with FOSS4G the superior performance of the Homolosine projection makes its choice difficult to avoid.},

The second section analyzes the geometric regularity of the model, showing that its facets are relatively similar, having vertices spaced uniformly in latitude and longitude, and areas that vary by less than 42 {\%} from their mean sizes. Section 3 describes some fundamental operations on this structure, including mapping from geographic coordinates into O-QTM addresses and back again, filtering map detail through the triangular hierarchy and associ-ating locations that are close together, but in different branches of the tree structure.

We propose evaluation metrics for these two criteria and present numerical results from these measures for several DGGSs. We also consider the impact of different design choices on these metrics, such as predominant tessellating shape, base modeling solid and partition density between recursive subdivisions. For the intercell distance metric, the Fuller-Gray DGGS performs best, while the Equal Angle DGGS performs substantially worse. For the cell wall midpoint metric, however, the Equal Angle DGGS has the lowest overall distortion with the Snyder and Fuller-Gray DGGSs also performing relatively well. Aggregation of triangles into hexagons has little impact on intercell distance measurements, although dual hexagon aggregation results in markedly different statistics and spatial patterns for the cell wall midpoint property. In all cases, partitions on the icosahedron outperform similar partitions on the octahedron. Partition density accounts for little variation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Transforming raw observations into geometrically regular global grids is a fundamental data processing and storage problem underlying much of our global data analysis. The basic geometry of traditionally employed quadrilateral-based point or area grids, while well suited to array storage and matrix manipulation, may inherently hinder numerical and geostatistical modeling efforts. Several scientists have noted the superior performance of triangular point grids and associated triangular cells that can be aggregated into hexagonal surface tessellations, yet, no thorough evaluation of discrete global grid alternatives has been conducted. We present results from a global grid comparison study that focused on recursive tiling of polyhedral faces projected onto the globe. A set of evaluation criteria for global partitioning methods were developed. Of these, metrics for spheroidal surface area, compactness, and centerpoint spacing were found to be of particular importance. We present examples of these metrics applied to compare different recursive map projection-based and quadrilateral spherical partitionings. One map projection approach, the Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA), shows particular promise due to its production of equal area triangular and hexagonal cells on the spheroid at all levels of recursive partitioning.},

abstract = {We analyzed the corpus of three geoscientific journals to investigate if there are enough locational references in research articles to apply a geographical search method, such as the example of New Zealand. Based on all available abstracts and all freely available papers of the “New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics”, the “New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research”, and the “Journal of Hydrology, New Zealand”, we searched title, abstracts, and full texts for place name occurrences that match records from the official Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) gazetteer. We generated ISO standard compliant metadata records for each article including the spatial references and made them available in a public catalogue service. This catalogue can be queried for articles based on authors, titles, keywords, topics, and spatial reference. We visualize the results in a map to show which area the research articles are about, and how much and how densely geographic space is described through these geoscientific research articles by mapping mentioned place names by their geographic locations. We outlined the methodology and technical framework for the geo-referencing of the journal articles and the platform design for this knowledge inventory. The results indicate that the use of well-crafted abstracts for journal articles with carefully chosen place names of relevance for the article provides a guideline for geographically referencing unstructured information like journal articles and reports in order to make such resources discoverable through geographical queries. Lastly, this approach can actively support integrated holistic assessment of water resources and support decision making.},

@article{Lei2020,
abstract = {In astronomy, physics, climate modeling, geoscience, planetary science, and many other disciplines, the mass of data often comes from spherical sampling. Therefore, establishing an efficient and distortion-free representation of spherical data is essential. This paper introduces a novel spherical (global) coordinate system that is free of singularity. Contrary to classical coordinates, such as Cartesian or spherical polar systems, the proposed coordinate system is naturally defined on the spherical surface. The basic idea of this coordinate system originated from the classical planar barycentric coordinates that describe the positions of points on a plane concerning the vertices of a given planar triangle; analogously, spherical area coordinates (SACs) describe the positions of points on a sphere concerning the vertices of a given spherical triangle. In particular, the global coordinate system is obtained by decomposing the globe into several identical triangular regions, constructing local coordinates for each region, and then combining them. Once the SACs have been established, the coordinate isolines form a new class of global grid systems. This kind of grid system has some useful properties: the grid cells exhaustively cover the globe without overlapping and have the same shape, and the grid system has a congruent hierarchical structure and simple relationship with traditional coordinates. These beneficial characteristics are suitable for organizing, representing, and analyzing spatial data.},

There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

The incredible size of geospatial data and differences between data sets pose challenges related to big data, data creation, and data integration. Advances in globe representation and visualization have made use of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGSs) that discretize the globe into a set of cells to which data are assigned. DGGSs are well studied and important in the GIS, OGC, and Digital Earth communities but have not been well-introduced to the computer graphics community. In this paper, we provide an overview of DGGSs and their use in digitally representing the Earth, describe several current Digital Earth systems and their methods of Earth representation, and list a number of applications of Digital Earths with related works. Moreover, we discuss the key research areas and related papers from computer graphics that are useful for a Digital Earth system, such as advanced techniques for geospatial data creation and representation.},

Despite growing interest amongst potential users in icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon DGGSs, the practical use of such systems has been hindered by a lack of efficient spatial indexing methods. In this paper we discuss the two primary approaches to developing multi-resolution location coding systems for DGGSs: pyramid addressing and path addressing. We then describe an efficient pyramid addressing system for icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon DGGSs, the quadrilateral 2-dimensional integer system. After reviewing the problems inherent in developing path addressing systems for hexagon-based DGGSs we describe a class of path-based location coding solutions for icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon DGGSs called modified generalized balanced ternary, and show how this system can be used to index vector data. We then discuss a subset of this system, the icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon tree, which can be used to index raster and bucket data structures.

This research investigated the feasibility of using the sinusoidal projection for global image database construction.

Reprojections between these five global projections and the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referencing system were performed using fifty-four sample datasets. A statistical analysis of categorical accuracy, a measure describing the omission of pixel values during reprojection, was conducted. Geographic coordinates and the sinusoidal projection both showed very high accuracy rates (100.0 percent and 99.5 percent respectively) when sample datasets were reprojected from UTM. The geographic coordinates, however, showed very low accuracy (65.3 percent) when sample datasets were reprojected to the UTM projection, while the sinusoidal projection showed the highest accuracy (98.4 percent). The results strongly suggest that the sinusoidal projection is very accurate and efficient for building global image databases.},

DGGS are designed to portray real-world phenomena by providing a spatiotemporal unified framework on a standard discrete geospatial data structure and theoretical support to address the challenges from big data storage, processing, and analysis to visualization and data sharing. In this paper, the trinity of big Earth observation data (BEOD), cloud computing, and DGGS is proposed, and based on this trinity theory, we explore the opportunities and challenges to handle BEOD from two aspects, namely, information technology and unified data framework. Our focus is on how cloud computing and DGGS can provide an excellent solution to enable big Earth observation data. Firstly, we describe the current status and data characteristics of Earth observation data, which indicate the arrival of the era of big data in the Earth observation domain. Subsequently, we review the cloud computing technology and DGGS framework, especially the works and contributions made in the field of BEOD, including spatial cloud computing, mainstream big data platform, DGGS standards, data models, and applications. From the aforementioned views of the general introduction, the research opportunities and challenges are enumerated and discussed, including EO data management, data fusion, and grid encoding, which are concerned with analysis models and processing performance of big Earth observation data with discrete global grid systems in the cloud environment.},

abstract = {Regular grid sampling structures in the plane are a common spatial framework for many studies. Constructing grids with desirable properties such as equality of area and shape is more difficult on a sphere. We studied the distortion characteristics of recursive partitions of the surface of the globe starting with the octahedron and icosahedron polyhedral models. We used five different methods for mapping from the polyhedral model to the surface of the sphere: the Gnomonic projection, Fuller's Dymaxion projection, Snyder's equal area polyhedral projection, direct spherical subdivision, and a recursive polyhedral projection. We increased partition density using both a 4-fold and a 9-fold ratio at each level of recursive subdivision by subdividing to the 8th level with the 4-fold density ratio (65 536 cells per polyhedral face) and to the fifth level with the 9-fold density ratio (59 049 cells per polyhedral face). We measured the area and perimeter of each cell at each level of recursion for each method on each model using each density ratio. From these basic measurements we calculated the range and standard deviation of the area measurement, and the mean, range, and standard deviation of a compactness measurement defined as the ratio of (the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the cell) to (the ratio of the perimeter to the area of a spherical circle with the same area). We looked at these basic measurements and their statistics using graphs of variation with recursion level, sums of squares analyses of variation, histograms of the distributions, maps of the spatial variation, and correlograms. The Snyder projection performed best in area distortion and the Gnomonic projection performed best in compactness distortion. The Fuller projection and the Sphere method had moderate distortion in both area and compactness relative to the worst methods. There was little difference in distortion performance between partitions using the 4-fold density ratio and those using the 9-fold density ratio. Partitions based on the icosahedron performed better for all statistics than those based on the octahedron. {\textcopyright} 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{White2000,
abstract = {In recent years a number of methods have been developed for subdividing the surface of the earth to meet the needs of applications in dynamic modeling, survey sampling, and information storage and display. One set of methods uses the surfaces of Platonic solids, or regular polyhedra, as approximations to the surface of the earth. Diamond partitions are similar to recursive subdivisions of the triangular faces of either the octahedron or icosahedron. This method views the surface as either four (octahedron) or ten (icosahedron) tessellated diamonds, where each diamond is composed of two adjacent triangular faces of the figure. The method allows for a recursive partition on each diamond, creating nested sub-diamonds, that is implementable as a quadtree, including the provision for a Peano or Morton type coding system for addressing the hierarchical pattern of diamonds and their neighborhoods, and for linearizing storage. Furthermore, diamond partitions, in an aperture-4 hierarchy, provide direct access through the addressing system to the aperture-4 hierarchy of hexagons developed on the figure. Diamond partitions provide a nested hierarchy of grid cells for applications that require nesting and diamond cells have radial symmetry for those that require this property. Finally, diamond partitions can be cross-referenced with hierarchical triangle partitions used in other methods.},
